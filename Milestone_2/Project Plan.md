## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a nutritional food comparison tool that enables users to analyze and visualize nutritional data through a graphical user interface (GUI). This system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for comparing nutritional values of food items, helping users make informed dietary decisions.

Goals include:
1. Data Analysis and Visualization: Enable users to analyze nutritional data through comparisons, filters, and graphical outputs.
2. Feature Development: Develop a desktop application with core features like food comparison, nutritional breakdown, and data filtering.
3. Comprehensive Documentation: Deliver user-friendly documentation, outlining how to install, use, and troubleshoot the application.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

The success of this project depends on several stakeholders, each playing an essential role:

1. Project manager - Responsible for overseeing the project, ensuring that timelines are met, resources are properly allocated, and quality standards are upheld. Key           responsibilities include risk management, budget control, and coordination between the project team and stakeholders.
2. Project team - The team comprises developers and analysts responsible for designing, developing, testing, and delivering the project. They are expected to collaborate       closely to ensure the features meet the project's objectives.
3. Customers/clients - These are the end-users of the application, typically fitness enthusiasts, nutritionists, and individuals seeking to compare nutritional values for      dietary planning.
4. Suppliers/Vendors - Responsible for providing the Nutritional Food Dataset that will serve as the core data for the system. They ensure the dataset is accurate,             complete, and up-to-date.

### 1.3 Project Scope

This project aims to develop a simple, user-friendly nutritional food comparison tool enabling users to analyse and visualise nutritional data through a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will focus on the following key areas:

In Scope:
1. Data Analysis and Visualization: The core focus is to develop a tool that allows users to analyze and compare the nutritional content of food items using graphical          representations such as pie charts, bar graphs, and tables.
2. Desktop Application Development: A desktop application will be created, providing an interactive and user-friendly GUI for accessing, filtering, and comparing data.
3. Feature Implementation: Features such as food comparison, nutrition filtering, and data visualization will be fully developed and integrated.
4. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation will be prepared for end-users and stakeholders, detailing the application’s functionality, installation instructions, and        troubleshooting guides.

Out of Scope:
1. Mobile or Web Versions: The project will focus solely on desktop application development, and no mobile or web-based versions will be created.
2. Advanced Analytics: Complex data analytics or machine learning models will not be part of this project.
3. Database Expansion: The project will rely on an existing nutritional database and will not include the addition of new data or extensive database expansion.

## 5. Food Nutrition Dataset

The Food_Nutrition_Dataset.csv serves as the central data source for this project. This dataset contains comprehensive nutritional information, including details about:

- Calories, fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
- Vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients.
- Water content and other nutritional parameters.

This dataset will be cleaned, validated, and integrated into the desktop application to enable accurate data visualization and analysis.
