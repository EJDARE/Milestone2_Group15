## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a simple data analysis and visualisation toolset for a dataset, achieved through the usage of a graphical user interface.

Goals include:
1. Developing a simple data analysis and visualisation tool
2. Creating a GUI to display the data
3. Identifying the Stakeholders and Project Scope

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

#### Key stakeholders
1. Project manager - A professional overseeing and leading a project from inception to completion. They play a crucial role in ensuring that a project is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the required quality standards. Key responsibilities are planning and defining scope, budgeting and cost management, team leadership, communication, risk management, time management, quality assurance, problem-solving, and project closure.
2. Project team - A collaborative unit of individuals who work together to achieve the objectives of a specific project. Each team member brings unique skills and expertise to the project, and their collective efforts, characterized by diverse skill sets, defined roles and responsibilities, collaboration and communication, shared objectives, problem-solving and decision-making, adaptability and leadership, are coordinated to ensure successful project delivery.
3. Customers/clients—The individuals, organizations, or entities that purchase or receive services or products from a business expect their needs or requirements to be met. They are not just stakeholders but the ultimate beneficiaries of any business or project, making their needs and expectations, decision-making power, diversity, feedback providers, value seekers, and brand perception key characteristics.
4. Suppliers/Vendors are entities that provide goods, services, or materials to businesses or organizations. They play a critical role in the supply chain by ensuring that the necessary inputs are available for production, operations, or resale. Key characteristics are product and service providers, critical to the supply chain, quality assurance, negotiation and contracts, dependability and timeliness, flexibility and adaptability.

### 1.3 Project Scope

This project aims to develop a simple, user-friendly nutritional food comparison tool enabling users to analyse and visualise nutritional data through a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will focus on the following key areas:

In Scope:
1. Data Analysis and Visualisation: The primary focus is to create a tool that allows users to perform fundamental data analysis and visualisation on a nutritional food dataset. The tool will help users compare and visualise nutritional information.
2. Desktop Application Development: The tool will be housed in a desktop application. The GUI will present data in a way that is accessible to users, allowing for easy interaction and comparison of nutritional information.
3. Feature Implementation: Core features such as food comparison, data filtering, and visualisation (e.g., graphs and charts) will be developed and integrated into the application.
4. Documentation: We are committed to creating comprehensive user documentation that will serve as a reliable guide for users on how to install, use, and troubleshoot the tool. The project report will also be developed to ensure all stakeholders are well-informed.

Out of Scope:
1. Mobile or Web Versions: This project will maintain a clear focus on developing a desktop application. No mobile or web-based versions will be developed, ensuring our efforts are concentrated on the primary goal.
2. Advanced Analytics: The project will not include advanced data analytics like predictive models or machine learning algorithms.
3. Expansion of the Nutritional Database: The project will utilise an existing nutritional database without extending it to include additional data or more complex nutritional profiles.
